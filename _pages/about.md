I am a Professor of Marketing at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, where I also hold the Charles H. Kellstadt Chair in Marketing. My research focuses on pricing, advertising, promotions, retailing and experimentation, using methods from causal inference, machine learning, and empirical industrial organization. I partner with companies to measure and enhance marketing effectiveness. My recent work examines digital advertising measurement methods while developing new evaluation approaches.

I am presently a co-editor at the [Journal of Marketing Research](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/mrj).

I am the co-creator of the "How I Wrote This" podcast.
