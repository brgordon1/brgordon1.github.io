This article provides a critical review of the academic literature on the long-run effects of marketing actions. We catalog the substantive findings, identify the dominant methodologies, and suggest avenues for future research. While the literature is rich, we find a predominance of studies using time-series data to investigate the long-run effects of advertising and promotion. We find fewer studies on the long-run effects of other marketing actions like new product introductions, distribution, and personal selling. We suggest that there are many opportunities to refine our understanding of the long-run effects of marketing. We also suggest a number of research priorities and highlight some of the key challenges that need to be overcome.
