This article reflects on the history and contributions of the Workshop on Quantitative Marketing and Structural Econometrics (QMSE). The workshop was founded to provide a forum for researchers applying structural modeling techniques to marketing problems. We review the evolution of the workshop, the types of research presented, and its impact on the field. We conclude with a discussion of future directions for structural modeling in marketing.
