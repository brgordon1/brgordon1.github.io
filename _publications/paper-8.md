This essay discusses the intersection of marketing and political science, highlighting how marketing models and frameworks can be applied to understand political phenomena. We explore several areas where marketing research offers insights, including voter behavior, political advertising, and the strategic decisions of candidates and parties. The discussion identifies key research questions and suggests promising avenues for future interdisciplinary work that can enrich both fields and have important policy implications.
